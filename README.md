# Static Sapling
Based on HTML5 Boilperlate.

Basically a custom build of HTML5 Boilerplate that we use here at Benchmark Studios. It is a great jumping off point for a new project and is used in almost all of our projects at the first stage when building static layouts. Feel free to use and abuse this. It will be updated in sync wioth Sapling.... hopefully. 


## Quick start

Clone the git repo - `git clone git://github.com/benchmarkstudios/Static-Sapling.git` - or [download it](http://github.com/benchmarkstudios/Static-Sapling/zipball/master)


## Features

* HTML5 ready. Use the new elements with confidence.
* Cross-browser compatible (Chrome, Opera, Safari, Firefox 3.6+, IE6+).
* Designed with progressive enhancement in mind.
* CSS normalizations and common bug fixes.
* IE-specific classes for easier cross-browser control.
* A default print stylesheet, performance optimized.
* Mobile browser optimizations.
* Protection against any stray `console.log` causing JavaScript errors in IE6/7.
* The latest jQuery via CDN, with a local fallback.
* A custom Modernizr build for feature detection.
* "Delete-key friendly." Easy to strip out parts you don't need.
